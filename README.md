# Maven-Assignment
There are two modules in a project, basically services and webapp. 
In webapp, we need to create a controller to create an endpoint that returns a message.
It is always a good practice to add a service layer before the controller layer.
Therefore, I have added a services layer in webapp for the same purpose. Then,
I tested my endpoint by writing an integration test and also using a unit test for the same.
